# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Charity organization analysis using neural networks

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a binary classifier, using a neural network, to attempt to predict whether applicant to a charity organization, Alphabet Soup, will be successful with their funding.
The starting dataset consisted of a CSV of over 34,000 organizations that received funding from Alphabet Soup. The columns in the dataset included:
* EIN and NAME — Identification columns
* APPLICATION_TYPE — Alphabet Soup application type
* AFFILIATION — Affiliated sector of industry
* CLASSIFICATION — Government organization classification
* USE_CASE — Use case for funding
* ORGANIZATION — Organization type
* STATUS — Active status
* INCOME_AMT — Income classification
* SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS — Special consideration for application
* ASK_AMT — Funding amount requested
* IS_SUCCESSFUL — Was the money used effectively

The libraries used were:
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Tensorflow

The goal was to attempt to develop a model with over 75% accuracy in predicting success from the given data.
